Our project `EcoLens` is a Flutter Application that aims to engage individuals and organizations in building a system enhances the learning experience of carbon waste.
<br><br>
Through our computer vision model, we are able to scan and detect specific objects alongside a `Information` button for the user to click. By clicking onto the button, a popup will appear providing more information regarding the product such as the model, the manufacturing carbon footprint, alternative products, and recommended usage for the specific product category.
